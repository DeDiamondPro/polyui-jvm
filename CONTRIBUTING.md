# Contributing
This documents outlines best-practices and contributing guidelines to PolyUI
See our OneConfig contributing guidelines for a more technical guide on how to start
developing for Polyfrost JVM-based projects.

## Guide: Pull Requests

1. ### Discuss your feature
   Be sure to talk to us (either through an issue or on [Discord](https://polyfrost.cc/discord) before working on your feature! We can help you with any questions you may have, and save some time during the review process.
2. ### Open your PR and wait for reviews
   Once you have forked PolyUI and opened a pull request, you need to wait for people to review it. When you get reviews, try to thoughtfully address any concerns other people have. If you get confused, be sure to ask questions!
