# Accreditation for PolyUI 
Along with the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPLv3), the following additional terms are also applicable to PolyUI (the "Software"):
 - We simply request that you adequately credit PolyUI in your project, and link to this repository. We request that you include some kind of visible accreditation to PolyUI, for example in an Info in your user Interface, or a note in your README, or on your project's website; for example with "built using PolyUI", with a link to the GitHub repository (which we require), in addition to the standard crediting policies of the LGPL licence in the source code.
